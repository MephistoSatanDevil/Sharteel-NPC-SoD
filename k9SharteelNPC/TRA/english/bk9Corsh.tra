@1 = ~You're still here? Maybe the Fist will make a fine soldier out of you yet.~
@2 = ~You think I wish to serve *these* imbeciles? Ha! What kind of fool do you think I am?~
@3 = ~I once spent time in the cell of the Fists. In a city as cold and unforgiving as Baldur's Gate sometimes it beats the alternative.~
@4 = ~I get that you're mad. I can't defend what was done to you. But maybe if you'd give the Fist another chance you'd see what good it does the city.~
@5 = ~Protecting the city from bandits, staffing the walls, securing the streets. The city would be chaos without us.~
@6 = ~Do you really think the Fist gives a damn about the poor, the orphans, the sick? I was an orphan on its streets for years. The Fist exist to serve the rich and powerful. Only a moron would think otherwise.~
@7 = ~And *that* is why only a weak, cowering, fool trusts others to provide their protection.~
@8 = ~I've heard about enough from you for a lifetime. You really are a lost cause.~
